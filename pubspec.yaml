# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - images/percentage.png
    - images/header.png
    - images/per_change.png
    - images/logo.png
    - images/per_decrease.png
    - images/per_increase.png
    - images/per_margin.png
    - images/per_of.png
    - images/tip.png
#    - images/bg.png
    - images/bg_main.png
#    - images/bg_1.png
#    - images/bg_2.png
    - images/main_logo.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SansSerif
      fonts:
#        - asset: fonts/Arsenal-Regular.ttf
#          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/Gotu-Regular.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: Serif
      fonts:
        - asset : fonts/Gabriela-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
